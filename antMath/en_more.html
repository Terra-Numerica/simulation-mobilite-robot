<h3>About ants mobility</h3>
<p>Ants are able to choose the shortest path to access a food source.</p>
<p>The first ant is the one who will lead the group and each ant follows the one in front of it.
    So the 100th ant will probably not take the same path as the 1st.</p>
<p>Moreover, the ants are not moving at the same speed, the gap between the ants fluctuate.<br>
    And as we can see in this simulation, the greater the gap is between two ants, the faster the
    shortest path will be found.</p>
<p>This simulation is interesting from an algorithmic point of view because it reflects part of the
    shortest path problem in Computer Science.</p>
