<h3>Tutorial about the simulation</h3>
<p>This is a tutorial to understand this simulation</p>
<p>The brown part is where the simulation will take place.
    To start it, just draw a line which will represent the path taken by the first ant.<br>
    Clicking on the mouse will therefore define the starting point and releasing it will place the end
    point for all ants.</p>
<p>At the top right is the Control Panel which will allow you to modify the parameters of the
    simulation.</p>
<p>At the bottom right is a graph which, depending on the number of the ant,
    shows you the number of steps it has taken to go from the starting point to the finishing point.
