                <h3>Tutorial about the simulation</h3>
                <p>This is a tutorial to understand this simulation</p>
                <p>The brown part is where the simulation will take place.
                    To start it, just draw a line which will represent the path taken by the first ant.<br>
                    Clicking on the mouse will therefore define the starting point and releasing it will place the end
                    point for all ants.</p>
                <p>At the top right is the Control Panel which will allow you to modify the parameters of the
                    simulation.</p>
                <p>At the bottom right is a graph which, depending on the number of the ant,
                    shows you the number of steps it has taken to go from the starting point to the finishing point.
                </p>

                <h3>Control Panel</h3>
                <p>This Control Panel will allow you to modify the parameters on the Simulation</p>
                <p><u>Speed Selection:</u> Allows you to change the speed of the ants</p>
                <p><u>Spacing Selection:</u> Allows you to modify the space between each ant (small, medium, large)</p>
                <p><u>All Path:</u> Allows you to display all the paths of each ants</p>
                <p><u>Pause Button:</u> Allows you to pause the simulation</p>
                <p><u>Reset Button:</u> Allows you to reset the simulation</p>
                <p><u>Download:</u> Allows you to download the current simulation in Gif format with 2 different links

                <h3>About ants mobility</h3>
                <p>Ants are able to choose the shortest path to access a food source.</p>
                <p>The first ant is the one who will lead the group and each ant follows the one in front of it.
                    So the 100th ant will probably not take the same path as the 1st.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the ants are not moving at the same speed, the gap between the ants fluctuate.<br>
                    And as we can see in this simulation, the greater the gap is between two ants, the faster the
                    shortest path will be found.</p>
                <p>This simulation is interesting from an algorithmic point of view because it reflects part of the
                    shortest path problem in Computer Science.</p>
